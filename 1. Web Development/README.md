## Course Description
<p>We'll learn Web Development via different Modules(eg. JS, Browser, React etc) and each Module will consist of different Activities(ie projects).
(This is considered to be a more better approach for learning dev)
All the study material and the assignments which I made/ got and did respectively for Web Development will be uploaded here.</p>

*This course is part of the "Pepcoding Placement Program".
